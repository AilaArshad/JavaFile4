Assignment 4

**Question 1**

Write a function that takes a number as its parameter. The function is to return the factorial of that numbergiven by 
user?

**Question 2**

A palindrome is a sequence of characters or numbers that looks the same forwards and backwards. For example,
"Madam, I'm Adam" is a palindrome because it is spelled the same reading it from front to back as from back to 
front. The number 12321 is a numerical palindrome. Write a function that takes a string and its length as 
arguments and recursively determines whether the string is a palindrome:
int ispalindrome(string s, int len).?

**Question 3**

Write a recursive function int count_digit(int n, int digit); to count the number of digits in a number n (n > 0) that 
are equal to a specified digit. For example, if the digit we're searching for were 2 and the number we're searching
were 220, the answer would be 2?

**Question 4**

We have n people in a room, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Each person shakes handsonce with
every other person. What is the total number, h(n) , of handshakes? Write a recursive function to solve this 
problem.

To get you started, if there are only one or two people in the room, then

handshake(1) = 0

handshake(2) = 1

If a third person enters the room, he orshe must shake hands with each of the two people already there.This is two 
handshakes in addition to the number of handshakes that would be made in a room of two people, or a total of 
three handshakes. If a fourth person enters the room, this is three handshakes in addition to the number of
handshakes that would be made in a room of three people handshakes. If youcan generalize this to n handshakes,
you should be able to write the recursive solution.

**Question 5**

The greatest common divisor of integers x and y is the largest integer that evenly divides both x and y.Write a
recursive function GCD that returns the greatest common divisor of x and y?

**Question 6**

Write a recursive function power (base, exponent) that when invoked returns base exponent. For example,power (3, 
4) = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3. Assume that exponent is an integer greater than or equal to 1?

**Question 7**

Write the reverse() function recursively. This function takes a string and the length of the string asarguments
and returns the same string with its characters in the reverse order?
